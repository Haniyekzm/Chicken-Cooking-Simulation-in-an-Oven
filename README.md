# Chicken Cooking Simulation in an Oven

## Overview
This project simulates the **cooking of chicken in an oven** by modeling heat transfer
inside the chicken.
It analyzes the heat distribution, the cooking time, and the effect of creating a cavity
inside the chicken.

The simulation produces an **animation** where:
- The X and Y coordinates represent the cross-section of the chicken.
- The temperature is represented by colors:
- Hotter regions appear closer to white.
- Colder regions appear closer to red.

Additionally, the code generates plots of temperature changes over time and calculates
the time required for the chicken to reach **430 K**.

## Features
- Heat transfer simulation inside the chicken.
- Animation of temperature distribution using a color map.
- Plot of temperature changes during cooking.
- Calculation of the cooking time to reach 450 K.

- Analysis of the effect of adding a cavity inside the chicken, allowing heat to spread
from the center.

## Visualization
- Animation of the 2D temperature distribution.
- Graphs showing the change of temperature in the chicken over time.
- Comparison of cooking times with and without a cavity in the center.
